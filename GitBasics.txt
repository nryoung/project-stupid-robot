===Git Basics===
To retrieve code for the first time:
	git clone git@github.com:nryoung/project-stupid-robot.git
To retrieve code every time after that:
	git pull origin

To make changes to a file:
	1. Do a 'git add X' where X is a file or folder that has changed that you want to commit.
	   To add ALL the files in the project, do 'git add .' in the main folder.
	2. Create a commit with 'git commit'.
	   Enter in a brief description of what you changed.
	3. Push the commit to the server with 'git push origin'
