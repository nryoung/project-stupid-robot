(i) Install Software on a single computer and use the Software with Microchip Products; and
(ii) At Licensee's own discretion and risk, use, modify, copy and distribute the device driver files ("Device Drivers") of the Software that are provided to Licensee in Source Code; provided that such Device Drivers are only used with Microchip Products and that no open source or free software is incorporated into such Device Drivers without the prior written consent of Microchip in each instance.

(ii) Third party may program Software into Microchip Products for Licensee.
(iii) Third party may use the Software to develop and/or manufacture Licensee Products.

4.	Confidentiality.  

      (a)	Licensee agrees that the Software (including but not limited to the Source Code, Object Code and library files) and its derivatives, Documentation and underlying inventions, algorithms, know-how and ideas relating to the Software and the Documentation are proprietary information belonging to Microchip and its licensors ("Proprietary Information").  Except as expressly and unambiguously allowed herein, Licensee will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Proprietary Information and shall similarly bind its employees and Third Party(ies) in writing.  Proprietary Information shall not include information that: (i) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement and through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) the receiving party was legally in possession of prior to receiving it; (iii) the receiving party can demonstrate was developed by it independently and without use of or reference to the disclosing party's Proprietary Information; or (iv) the receiving party receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure.  If Licensee is required to disclose Proprietary Information by law, court order, or government agency, such disclosure shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement provided that Licensee gives Microchip prompt notice of such requirement in order to allow Microchip to object or limit such disclosure, Licensee cooperates with Microchip to protect Proprietary Information, and Licensee complies with any protective order in place and discloses only the information required by process of law.  
      
      (b)	Licensee agrees that the provisions of this Agreement regarding unauthorized use and nondisclosure of the Software, Documentation and related Proprietary Rights are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Microchip and its licensors and that monetary damages alone cannot adequately compensate Microchip or its licensors if such provisions are violated.  Licensee, therefore, agrees that if Microchip alleges that Licensee or Third Party has breached or violated such provision then Microchip will have the right to petition for injunctive relief, without the requirement for the posting of a bond, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity.

5.	Ownership of Proprietary Rights.

Further, copies and derivative works shall be considered works made for hire with ownership vesting in Microchip on creation.  To the extent such modifications and derivatives do not qualify as a "work for hire," Licensee hereby irrevocably transfers, assigns and conveys the exclusive copyright thereof to Microchip, free and clear of any and all liens, claims or other encumbrances, to the fullest extent permitted by law.  Licensee and Third Party use of such modifications and derivatives is limited to the license rights described in Section 2 above.
